# Module-12-Challenge-NoSQL-Databases


This is a completed project with two parts. In the first file (NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb) I updated the database so that it could be of relevant use in the second file. 
The second file (NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb) builds Pandas dataframes through queries. 

Citations: Lecture, solved practice activites, Stack Overflow and Google were all resourceful in helping me.
